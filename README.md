# BitDance PCQA Metric

BitDance: Low Complexity Point Cloud Quality Assessment Metric

BitDance is a fast, OpenMP optimized implementation of the technique described in
[Color and Geometry Texture Descriptors for Point-Cloud Quality Assessment](2021_SLP_Rafael.pdf).

This repository contains the code for all discussed algorithms in the article. The C++ code produces
three binaries: bitdance_pcqa, create_normals and optimize_voxel_size. The bitdance_pcqa calculates
the color and geometry PC feature statistics; create_normals creates PCs with oriented normals; and
optimize_voxel_size uses a parameterized heuristic and constant to provide a voxel size for a given
PC. In directory "distance_calculation", it is present the python script we developed for statistics
distance calculation, which includes the Jensen-Shannon divergence code, among others.


## Compilation

This code depends on the Open3D library: https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D

The code was compiled and tested on Debian Linux 11 (codename Bullseye) and
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. To install the Open3D library and other dependencies, run
(as root):

    apt-get install libopen3d-dev libeigen3-dev libpng-dev  zlib1g-dev

In order to compile the code, written in C++, open the Makefile, adjust it to your preferred C++
compiler, set to your Open3D installation prefix path (no need for any
modification on Debian 11 or Ubuntu 22.04),
and run:

    make


## Usage

Prior to the execution of the metric, normals without ambiguities need to be created. For this use:

    create_normals point_cloud.ply pc_with_normals.ply

In order to obtain the target voxel edge size of a PC, given a "k" constant ("k" equals to 6.0 in
the article), using the average distance of 8 nearest neighbors (hardcoded in the code) as
reference, as described in the article, use:

    optimize_voxel_size 3 k point_cloud.ply

To run the CIEDE2000 color-based feature extractor with 8 bits label, neighborhood size of 12,
voxel size (use the output of optimize_voxel_size) "E", with the statistics (histograms) results written to "results-c.csv",  use:

    bitdance_pcqa -i point_cloud.ply -n 12 -m 0,1,0,0,0 -v E -h results-c.csv

To run the geometry-based feature extractor with label of 16-bit, neighborhood size of 6, without the
use of voxelization (voxelization does not help for the geometry-based feature extractor), with
the statistics (histograms) results written to "results-g.csv", use:

    bitdance_pcqa -i pc_with_normals.ply -n 6 -m 0,0,1,0,0 -h results-g.csv
